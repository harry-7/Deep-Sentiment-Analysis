# Deep-Sentiment-Analysis
## Description
Sentiment analysis of twitter tweets using deep learning techniques
### Models implemented so far
- LSTM model 
- Fully connected neural network model which trains on doc vectors
## Environment
Python2, Linux system (Preferable)

## Memory requirements 
- 4GB RAM recommended for LSTM model
- 8 GB RAM recommended for FCNN model

## Dependencies
- python2
- pip (for python2)
- cuda library (if you want to use gpu accelaration for training)
- once you install these dependencies run `pip2 install -r requirements.txt`

## Layout
- `src/` folder which contains all codes
	- `config.py` contains the config of all the parameters needed
	- `model.py` contains the abstract class for all the models
	- `test_results.py` contains class to hold results of testing a model
	- `<name>_model.py` contains implementation code for corresponding models
	- `utils.py` contains utility functions
- `data/` which contains training and test data
- `models/` directory where the models are stored
